### Simple tg bot (client) which monitors choosen channels and copy info from them to another place.

To use this bot you should get api_hash and api_id for your app here: https://my.telegram.org/apps
You should also have docker installed.

You need to create file with channels username which you want to get posts from.
e.g. channelfile:

```
username1
username2
username3
# username4 - will be ignored
username5
....
```

To start app you need to run bootstrap script with info from previous steps:

```
echo your_api_id > SECRET_DIR/api_id
echo your_api_hash > SECRET_DIR/api_hash
./bootstrap.sh --secret-dir /path/to/SECRET_DIR --channel-file path/to/channelfile --main-channel your_tg_channel
```

**Please, note: on the first run (e.g. you do not have session file yet) you will have to login into your telegramm account**
